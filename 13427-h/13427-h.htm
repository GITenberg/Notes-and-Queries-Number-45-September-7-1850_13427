<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>The First Mole in Cornwall; a Morality from the Stowe of
Morwenna, in the Rocky Land.</i>&mdash;A lonely life for the dark
and silent mole! She glides along her narrow vaults, unconscious of
the glad and glorious scenes of earth, and air, and sea! She was
born, as it were, in a grave, and in one long living sepulchre she
dwells and dies! Is not existence to her a kind of doom? Wherefore
is she thus a dark, sad exile from the blessed light of day?
Hearken! Here, in our own dear Cornwall, the first mole was a lady
of the land! Her abode was in the far west, among the hills of
Morwenna, beside the Severn sea. She was the daughter of a lordly
race, the only child of her mother, and the father of the house was
dead. Her name was Alice of the Lea. Fair was she and comely,
tender and tall; and she stood upon the threshold of her youth. But
most of all did men wonder at the glory of her large blue eyes.
They were, to look upon, like the summer waters, when the sea is
soft with light! They were to her mother a joy, and to the maiden
herself&mdash;ah! benedicite&mdash;a pride. She trusted in the
loveliness of those eyes, and in her face, and features, and form:
and so it was that the damsel was wont to pass the summer's day, in
the choice of rich apparel, and precious stones, and gold. Howbeit
this was one of the ancient and common customs of those old
departed days. Now, in the fashion of her stateliness, and in the
hue and texture of her garments, there was none among the maidens
of old Cornwall like Alice of the Lea. Men sought her far and nigh,
but she was to them all, like a form of graven stone, careless and
cold. Her soul was set upon a Granville's love, fair Sir Bevil of
Stowe, the flower of the Cornish chivalry&mdash;that noble
gentleman! that valorous knight! He was her star. And well might
she wait upon his eyes; for he was the garland of the
west&mdash;the loyal soldier of a sainted king. He was that stately
Granville who lived a hero-life, and died a warrior's death!</p>
<p>Now there was signal made of banquet in the halls of Stowe, of
wassail, and the dance. The messengers had sped, and Alice of the
Lea would be there. Robes, precious and many, were unfolded from
their rest, and the casket poured forth jewel and gem, that the
maiden might stand before the knight victorious! It was the
day&mdash;the hour&mdash;the time. Her mother sate by her wheel at
the hearth. The page waited in the hall. She came down in her
loveliness into the old oak room, and stood before the mirrored
glass. Her robe was of woven velvet, rich, and glossy, and soft;
jewels shone like stars in the midnight of her raven hair, and on
her hand there gleamed, afar off, a bright and glorious ring! She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id=
"page226"></a>{226}</span> stood&mdash;she gazed upon her own
countenance and form, and worshipped! "Now all good angels succour
thee, dear Alice, and bend Sir Bevil's soul! Fain am I to see thee
a wedded wife, before I die! I yearn to hold thy children on my
knee! Often shall I pray to-night that the Granville heart may
yield! Thy victory shall be my prayer!"</p>
<p>"Prayer!" was the haughty answer; "with the eyes that I see in
that glass, and this vesture meet for a queen, I lack no doubting
prayer!"</p>
<p>Saint Mary shield us! Ah words of evil soul! There was a
shriek&mdash;a sob&mdash;a cry: and where was Alice of the Lea?
Vanished&mdash;gone. They had heard wild tones of sudden music in
the air. There was a rush&mdash;a beam of light&mdash;and she was
gone, and that for ever! East sought they her, and west, in
northern paths and south; but she was never more seen in the lands.
Her mother wept till she had not a tear left; none sought to
comfort her, for it was vain. Moons waxed and waned, and the crones
by the cottage-hearth had whiled away many a shadowy night with
tales of Alice of the Lea.</p>
<p>But, at the last, as the gardener in the Pleasance leaned one
day on his spade, he saw among the roses a small round hillock of
earth, such as he had never seen before, and upon it something
which shone. It was her ring! It was the very jewel she had worn
the day she vanished out of sight! They looked earnestly upon it,
and they saw within the border (for it was wide) the tracery of
certain small fine letters in the ancient Cornish tongue, which
said,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Beryan Erde,</p>
<p>Oyn und Perde!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then came the priest of the Place of Morwenna, a gray and silent
man! He had served long years at a lonely altar, a bent and
solitary form. But he had been wise in the language of his youth,
and he read the legend thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The earth must hide</p>
<p>Both eyes and pride!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, as he uttered these words, they stood in the Pleasance by
the mound; and on a sudden there was a low faint cry! They beheld,
and O wondrous and strange! there was a small dark creature,
clothed in a soft velvet skin, in texture and in hue like the Lady
Alice her robe; and they saw, as it went into the earth, that it
moved along without eyes, in everlasting night. Then the ancient
priest wept, for he called to mind all these things, and saw what
they meant; and he showed them how this was the maiden, who had
been visited with doom for her pride. Therefore her rich array had
been changed into the skin of a creeping thing and her large proud
eyes were sealed up; and she herself had become</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The first mole!</p>
<p>Of the hillocks of Cornwall!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ah! woe is me! and well-a-day! that damsel so stately and fair,
sweet Lady Alice of the Lea, should be made for a
judgement&mdash;the dark mother of the moles!</p>
<p>Now take ye good heed, Cornish maidens, how ye put on vain
apparel, to win love. And cast down your eyes, all ye damsels of
the west, and look ye meekly on the ground! Be ye good and gentle,
tender and true; and when ye see your image in the glass, and begin
to be lifted up with the beauty of that shadowy thing, call to mind
the maiden of Morwenna, her noble eyes and comely countenance, the
vesture of price and the glittering ring. Sit ye by the wheel, as
of old they sate and as ye draw the lengthening wool, sing ye
ever-more and say,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Beryan Erde,</p>
<p>Oyn and Perde!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>"A whistling Wife" &amp;c.&mdash;I can supply another version of
the couplet quoted in "Folk Lore" (Vol. ii., p. 164.), which has
the merit of being more rhymical and mysterious. In what district
it was current I know not.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A whistling wife and a crowing hen</p>
<p>Will call the old gentleman out of his den."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="author">G.L.B.</p>
<p><i>A Charm for Warts.</i>&mdash;In some parts of Ireland,
especially towards the south, they place great faith in the
following charm:&mdash;When a funeral is passing by, they rub the
warts and say three times, "May these warts and this corpse pass
away and never more return;" sometimes adding, "in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."</p>
<p class="author">JARLTZBERG.</p>
<p><i>"Hanging out the Broom".</i>&mdash;Besides the instance given
by Mr. R.F. Johnson (Vol. i., p. 384.), perhaps some of your
readers can inform me of the origin of a somewhat similar custom,
applicable to all ships and vessels for sale or hire, by the broom
(all old one being generally used) being attached to the mast-head:
if of two masts, to the foretop-mast head.</p>

<h3>LORD PLUNKET AND SAINT AGOBARD.</h3>
<p>Some of your readers may remember a speech in parliament by, as
I think, Lord Plunket, in which his lordship argued with great
eloquence in behalf of the Bill for the Emancipation of the Roman
Catholics. Among many passages therein of equal truth and
rhetorical power, there was one long afterwards much quoted,
paraphrased, and praised. It was that in which he reminded the
House, that those for whom he pleaded were fellow-subjects of the
same race, offspring of the same Creator, alike believers in the
One true God, the equal recipients of His mercies, appealing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id=
"page227"></a>{227}</span> His blessings though the medium of the
same faith, and looking forward for salvation to the One
Intercessor, Mediator, and Sacrifice for all,&mdash;men, who, as
they did, addressed the Eternal in the form of that "Universal
prayer"&mdash;Our Father&mdash;the authority and the privilege of
one common parentage, offered by the all in the union of the same
spirit, in the conviction of the same wants, in the aspiration of
the same hope. I say, I think Lord Plunket so spoke, for I write
from memory dating from the period when George the Third was king.
Now be this so: according to the dogmas of some critics, Lord
Plunket may be convicted of an eloquent plagiary. Read the
following extract from a missive by S. Agobard, to be found in the
<i>Bibl. Vet. Patrum</i>, tome xiii, page 429., by Galland,
addressed "Ad pr&aelig;fatum Imperatorem, adversus legem Gundobadi
et impia certamina qu&aelig; per eam geruntur," and say whether, in
spite of the separation of centuries, there does not appear a
family likeness, though there were no family acquaintance between
them; Saint Agobard being Bishop of Lyons in the ninth century, and
Lord Plunket Attorney-General for Ireland in the nineteenth.</p>
<p>The Saint is pleading against the judical ordeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Illi autem profecti, pr&aelig;dicaverunt ubique Domino
cooperante; annuntiataque est ab eis omni creatur&aelig;; id est,
cunetis nationibus mundi; una fides indita per Deum, una spes
diffusa per Spiritum Sanctum in cordibus credentium, una caritas
nata in omnibus, una voluntas, accensum unum desiderium, tradita
una oratio; ut omnes omnino ex diversis gentibus, diversis
conditionibus, diverso sexu, nobilitate, honestate, servitute
diversa, simul dicant uni Deo, et Patri omnium; Pater Noster qui
es, &amp;c., sicut unum Patrem invocantes, ita unam santificationem
qu&aelig;rentes, unum regnum postulantes, unam adimpletionem
voluntatis ejus, sicut fit in coelo optantes; unum sibi panem
quotidianum dari precantes et omnibus dimitti debita."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which other passages might be added, as, in fact, S. Agobard
pursues the one idea until he hunts it down to the one effect of
sameness and common antithesis. Should we say Lord Plunket had read
these passages, and is thereby convicted of eloquent plagiary? I
say, No! Lauder then equally convicted Milton of trespassing on the
thoughts of others, by somewhat apposite quotations from the
classics. We are, in truth, too much inclined to this. The little,
who cannot raise themselves to the stature of the great, are apt to
strive after a socialist level, by reducing all to one same
standard&mdash;their own. Truth is common to all ages, and will
obtain utterance by the truthful and the eloquent throughout all
time.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION OF MR. CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK OF
LONDON</h3>
<p>14. <i>Long Acre.</i> Mr. Cunningham, upon the authority of
Parton's <i>History of St. Giles's</i>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First known as the Elms, then called Seven Acres, and since
1612, from the length of a certain slip of ground, then first used
as a public pathway, as Long Acre."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter part of this statement is incorrect. The Seven Acres
were known as <i>Long Acre</i> as early as 1552, when they were
granted to the Earl of Bedford. See <i>Strype</i>, B. vi. p.
88.</p>
<p>Machyn, in his <i>Diary</i>, printed by the Camden Society, p.
21., under the date A.D. 1556, has the following allusion to the
<i>Acre</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The vj day of December the Abbot of Westminster went a
procession with his convent. Before him went all the Santuary men
with crosse keys upon their garments, and after went iij for
murder: on was the Lord Dacre's sone of the North, was wypyd with a
shett abowt him for kyllyng of on Master West, squyre, dwellyng
besyd ... and anodur theyff that dyd long to one of Master
Comtroller ... dyd kylle Recherd Eggylston the Comtroller's
tayller, and kylled him in the <i>Long Acurs</i>, the bak-syd
Charyng Crosse."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>15. <i>Norfolk House, St. James's Square.</i> The present
Norfolk House was built from a design by R. Brettingham, in 1742,
by Thomas Duke of Norfolk, and finished by his brother Edward in
1762. Mr. Cunningham speaks as if the old house, in which George
III. was born, was still standing.</p>
<p>16. <i>Soho Square.</i> Mr. Cunningham has not corrected his
mistake about Mrs. Cornelys's house in this square, (see "Notes and
Queries," vol. i., pp. 244, 450.). <i>D'Almaine's</i>, which Mr.
Cunningham confounds with Mrs. Cornelys's, was at a former period
tenanted by the Duke of Argyll; then by the Earl of Bradford; and,
at a later time, by the celebrated Onslow, who held his
parliamentary levees in the principal drawing-room. The ceilings of
the best rooms are adorned with paintings by Rebecca and Angelica
Kauffman.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham has taken some pains to destroy the
<i>Pennant</i> tradition concerning the name of this square, but he
has not given us one important piece of information, <i>i.e.</i>
that between the years 1674 and 1681, the ground was surveyed by
<i>Gregory King</i>, an eminent architect of those days, who
projected the square with the adjacent streets. Query, Did it not
take the name of <i>King's</i> Square from the architect? This
seems very probable; more especially as the statue of Charles I.
was not placed in the square until the beginning of the next
century. The centre space was originally occupied by a splendid
fountain, (the work of Colley Cibber's father), an estimate of the
"cost and charges" of which is now before me.</p>
<p>Among the eminent inhabitants of this square, not noticed by Mr.
Cunningham, were the following:&mdash;Lord <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> Berkely,
Lord Byron, Lord Grimstone, Lord Howard, Lord Leicester, Sir Thomas
Mansel, Lord Morpeth, Lord Nottingham, Lord Peterborough, Lord
Pierrepoint, Lord Pigot, Dudley North, the Earl of Dartmouth, the
Duchess of Cleveland, the Duchess of Wharton, &amp;c. These names
appear in the books of the parish of St. Anne, between the years of
1708 and 1772.</p>
<p>17. <i>Surrey Institution.</i> At one period (about 1825), this
building was known as the <i>Blackfriars Rotundo</i>. Here that
execrable character, Robert Taylor, who styled himself "the Devil's
Chaplain," delivered his blasphemous discourses.</p>
<p>18. <i>Opera House.</i> Mr. Cunningham, speaking of the
translation of <i>Arsinoe</i>, the first Anglo-Italian opera
performed in this country, says: "The translation was made by
Thomas Clayton." This is an error, for Clayton himself says, in his
preface: "I was obliged to have an Italian opera translated."
Clayton was the composer of the music.</p>
<p>19. <i>James's (St.) Chapel, St. James's Palace.</i> Mr.
Cunningham says, "The service is chanted by the boys of the Chapel
Royal." This ought to read, "The service is chaunted by the boys
<i>and gentlemen</i> of the Chapel Royal" The musical service of
our cathedrals and collegiate establishments cannot be performed
without four kinds of voices, treble, alto, tenor, and bass.</p>
<p>20. <i>Bagnigge Wells.</i> Mr. Cunningham makes a strange
mistake concerning this once popular place of amusement when he
says, "first opened to the public in the year 1767." A stone, still
to be seen, let into the wall over what was formerly the garden
entrance, has the following inscription:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"S + T</p>
<p>This is Bagnigge</p>
<p>Hovse neare</p>
<p>The Pinder a</p>
<p>Wakefeilde</p>
<p>1680."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The gardens were first opened for the accommodation of persons
who partook of the mineral springs; subsequently, amusements were
added; and in Bickham's curious work, <i>The Musical
Entertainer</i> (circa 1738), is an engraving of Tom Hippersley
mounted in the "singing rostrum," regaling the company with a song.
About half a century after this date, a regular orchestra was
erected, and the entertainments resembled Marylebone Gardens and
Vauxhall. The old house and gardens were demolished in 1842, to
make room for several new streets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To which he [Plato] may possibly have referred in his phrase

<p>Possibly Coleridge may have borrowed this from Berkeley's

occurs in Proclus and Marinus (see Valpy's <i>Stephani

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Capture of Henry VI.</i> (Vol. ii., p. 181.).&mdash;There are
several errors in this historical note. The name of the Dean of
Windsor was Manning, not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"
id="page229"></a>{229}</span> "Manting;" "Brungerly" should be
Bungerley. One of the Talbots, of Bashall Hall, could never be
"High Sheriff for the West Riding," as the Ridings of Yorkshire
never had distinct sheriffs; neither was he sheriff of the county.
The particulars of the king's capture are thus related in the
chronicle called Warksworth's <i>Chronicle</i>, which has been
printed by the Camden Society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Also, the same yere, kynge Henry was takene byside a howse of
religione [i.e. Whalley] in Lancashyre, by the mene of a blacke
monke of Abyngtone [Abingdon] in a wode called Cletherwode [the
wood of Clitheroe], besyde Bungerly hyppyngstones, by Thomas
Talbott, sonne and heyre to sere Edmunde Talbot of Basshalle, and
Jhon Talbott, his cosyne, of Colebry [i.e. Salebury, in Blackburn],
withe other moo; which discryvide [him] beynge at his dynere at
Wadyngton halle: and [he was] carryed to London on horsebake, and
his leges bownde to the styropes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have substituted the word "discryvide" for "disseyvide," as it
is printed in the Camden Society's book, where the editor, Mr.
Halliwell, understood the passage as meaning that the king was
deceived or betrayed. I take the meaning to be that the black monk
of Abingdon had descried, or discovered, the king as he was eating
his dinner at Waddington Hall; whereupon the Talbots, and some
other parties in the neighbourhood, formed plans for his
apprehension, and arrested him on the first convenient opportunity,
as he was crossing the ford across the river Ribble, formed by the
hyppyngstones at Bungerley. Waddington belonged to Sir John
Tempest, of Bracewell, who was the father-in-law of Thomas Talbot.
Both Sir John Tempest and Sir James Harrington of Brierley, near
Barnsley, were concerned in the king's capture, and each received
one hundred marks reward; but the fact of Sir Thomas Talbot being
the chief actor, is shown by his having received the larger reward
of 100&pound;. Further particulars respecting these and other
parties concerned, will be found in the notes to Warksworth's
<i>Chronicle</i>. The chief residence of the unhappy monarch during
his retreat was at Bolton Hall, where his boots, his gloves, and a
spoon, are still preserved, and are engraved in Whitaker's
<i>Craven</i>. An interior view of the ancient hall at Bolton,
which is still remaining, is engraved in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> for May, 1841. Sir Ralph Pudsay, of Bolton, had
married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Tunstal, who attended the
king as esquire of the body.</p>

<h2>QUERIES</h2>
<h3>JOHN JOKYN, OR JOACHIM, THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR.</h3>
<p>I am very desirous to be informed in what <i>French</i> author I
can find any account of John Jokyn (Joachim?), who was ambassador
to England from France during the time of Cardinal Wolsey. I have
looked into the greater part of the French authors who have written
historically on the reign of Fran&ccedil;ois I. without having
found any mention of such personage&mdash;<i>L'Art de
v&eacute;rifier les Dates</i>, &amp;c., without success. He is
frequently spoken of by English writers, and particularly in the
<i>Union of the Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke</i>, by Edward
Halle, 1548, folios 135, 136, 139, 144, and 149.; at folio 144.,
17th year of Hen. VIII., it is stated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There came over as ambassador from France, Jhon Jokyn, now
called M. de Vaux, which, as you have heard in the last year, was
kept secret in Master Lark's house; and when he came into England
he was welcomed of the Cardinal (Wolsey), and there between them
were such communications at the suit of the said Jhon, that a truce
was concluded from the 13th of July for forty days between England
and France, both on the sea, and beyond the sea," &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This M. Jokyn, or Joachim, appears to have been a person of
considerable influence, and it appears his purpose on this mission
was to bribe Wolsey; and it seems that the Chancellor Duprat was
aware of this, and was much displeased on the occasion.</p>

<hr />
<h3>SCRIPTURES, ROMAN CATHOLIC TRANSLATIONS OF, LUTHER'S
FAMILIARITY WITH.</h3>
<p>The replies I have gained to previous Queries encourage me to
trouble you with the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Has the Roman Catholic Church ever published a translation of
the Scriptures, or any part of them, into the vernacular
<i>Irish</i>? Have their missionaries in <i>China</i> ever
translated anything beyond the Epistles and Gospels of the Missal?
Or, is there any Roman Catholic translation into any of the
vernacular languages of <i>India</i>? Or, are there any versions in
any of the American dialects by Roman Catholic authors, besides
those mentioned by Le Long in his <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>. And is
there any continuation of his work up to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>{230}</span> the
present day? I am acquainted with Bishop Marsh's volume, but he
seems ill-informed and speaks vaguely about Roman Catholic
versions.</p>
<p>2. What is the authority for the familiar story of a bill being
brought into parliament for the suppression of all vernacular
translations in Richard II.'s reign, and of its being stoutly
opposed by John of Gaunt? "What, are we the dregs of the earth not
to hear the Scriptures in our own tongue?" Usher mentions the
circumstance (<i>Historia Dogmatica</i>, &amp;c.), and it is
borrowed from him by Fox. But I am so ignorant as not to know the
original and cotemporary authority.</p>
<p>3. Your learned correspondent, DR. MAITLAND, in his <i>Dark
Ages</i>, snubs D'Aubign&eacute; most unmercifully for repeating an
old story about Luther's stumbling upon a Bible, and pooh-pooh's
D'Aubign&eacute;'s authority, Mathesius, as no better than a goose.
May I ask whether it is possible to discover the probable
foundation of such a story, and whether Luther has left us in his
writings any account of his early familiarity with Scripture, that
would bear upon the alleged incident, and show how much of it may
be true?</p>

where I can see the grant mentioned in the following <i>note</i>
taken from Strype's <i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i>, vol. iii. p.
542: "I find a grant to the Lady Jane Partrige for life, of the
manor of Kenne in Devon, of the yearly value of 57<i>l.</i>

any of your readers tell me how to obtain access to a private act
1st Mary, Sessio secunda. cap. 9., anno 1553, intituled, "An Act
for the Restitution in Blood of the Heirs of Sir Miles Partrige,
Knight"? Strype calls it an act for the restitution of the
daughters of Sir Miles Partrige, and I think he must be right, as I
have prim&acirc; facie proof that Sir Miles left no son. Were the
debates on the acts of parliament recorded in those days, and if
so, how can they be seen?</p>

<p><i>Commoner marrying a Peeress.</i>&mdash;Formerly, when a
commoner married a peeress in her own right, he assumed her title
and dignity. The right was, I believe, disputed during the reign of
Henry VIII., in the case of the claimant of the barony of Talbois,
when it was decided that no man could take his wife's titles unless
he had issue male by her, but, if there were such issue, he became,
as in cases of landed property, "tenant by curtesy" of her
dignities. Can any of your correspondents inform me whether any
subsequent decision has deprived of this right a commoner marrying
a peeress and having issue male by her?</p>

sanctuary.</p>
<p>Can any of your learned contributors inform me (for I am totally
ignorant) the origin and intent of this strange accompaniment of
the burial of the ancient dead. The comb of St. Cuthbert is, I
believe, carefully preserved by the Dean and Chapter of Durham.</p>

<p>1. Has not the bibliographer assigned a wrong date to the
publication of Cave's <i>Historia Literaria</i>, viz. 1740, instead

</blockquote>
<p>And the same definition is given by Landais (Paris, 4to., 1842),
but this does not give the derivation or literal signification of
the word "<i>morganatic</i>." It is not in Johnson's
<i>Dictionary</i>; but in Smart's <i>Dictionary Epitomized</i>
(Longman and Co., 1840) it is thus given:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Morganatic, <i>a.</i>, applied to the marriage in which a gift
in the morning is to stand in lieu of dowry, or of all right of
inheritance, that might otherwise fall to the issue."</p>

<p>This, however, is inconsistent with the definition of
<i>nocturne</i>, <i>myst&eacute;rieux</i>, for the gift in lieu of
dowry would have nothing of mystery in it.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>POETA ANGLICUS.</h3>
<p>Every proof or disproof of statements continually made with
regard to the extravagant titles assumed, or complacently received,
by the bishops of Rome being both interesting and important, the
inquiry of J.B. (Vol. ii., p. 167.) is well deserving of a reply.
Speaking of a passage cited by Joannes Andre&aelig;, in his gloss
on the preface to the Clementines, he asks, "who is the Anglicus
Poeta?" and "what is the name of his poem," in which it is said to
the pope, "Nec Deus es nec homo, quasi neuter es inter
utrumque?"</p>
<p>"Poetria nova" was the name assigned to the hexameter poem
commencing, "Papa stupor mundi," inscribed, about the year 1200, to
the reigning Pope, Innocent III., by Galfridus de Vino salvo. Of
this work several manuscript copies are to be met with in England.
I will refer only to two in the Bodleian, Laud. 850. 83.: Ken.
Digb. 1665. 64. Polycarp Leyser (<i>Hist. Poem. medii
&AElig;vi</i>) published it in 1721; and Mabillon has set forth
another performance by the same writer in elegiac verse (<i>Vet.
Analect.</i> pp. 369-76., Paris, 1723). In the latter case the
author's name is not given, and accordingly he is entered merely as
"Poeta vetus" in Mr. Dowling's <i>Notitia Scriptorum SS. Pat.</i>,
sc. p. 279., Oxon., 1839. Your correspondent may compare with
Andre&aelig;'s extract these lines, and those which follow them, p.
374.:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Papa brevis vox est, sed virtus nominis hujus</p>
<p>Perlustrat quiequid arcus uterque tenet."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Galfridus evidently derived his surname from his treatise on
vines and wine; and he has been singularly unfortunate in the
epithet, for I have never seen VIN-SAUF correctly printed. It
varies from "de Nine salvo" to "<i>Mestisauf</i>." Pits and Oudin
call him "Vinesalf" and Fabricius and Mansi change him into "Vine
fauf."</p>
<p>The question now remains, Are the Roman Pontiffs and their
Church answerable for the toleration of such language? Uncertainty
may on this occasion be removed by our recollection of the fact,
that a "Censura" upon the glosses of the papal canon law, by
Manriq, Master of the Sacred Palace, was issued by the command of
Pope Pius V. in 1572. It was reprinted by Pappus, Argent. 1599,
12mo., and 1609, 8vo., and it contains an order for the expurgation
of the words before quoted, together with the summary in the
margin, "Papa nec Deus est nec homo," which appears in every old
edition; for instance, in that of Paris, 1532, sig. aa. iij. So far
the matter looks well, and the prospect is not hopeless. These
glosses, however, were revised by another master of the Apostolic
Palace, Sixtus Fabri, and were edited, under the sanction of Pope
Gregory XIII., in the year 1580; and from this authentic impression
the impious panegyric has not been withdrawn. The marginal
abridgment has, in compliance with Manriq's direction, been
exterminated; and this additional note has been appended as a
palliative:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. Valerius Andreas, however, gives a somewhat different account

Lovan, 1623, p. 609., he says:</p>

<p>3. Franciscus Sweertius (<i>Athen&aelig; Belgricoe</i>, ed.
Antv. 1628, p. 565.) gives a similar account to this of Valerius
Andreas.</p>
<p>4. And the account given by Christopher Hendreich Brandebargca,
(ed. Berolini, 1699, p. 193.) is substantially the same; viz.,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anglicus Michael cognomine, sed natione Gallus, patria
Belmontensis, utriusque juris Professor, scripsit Eclogarum, lib.

</blockquote>
<p>5. Moreri takes notice of this apparent confusion made between
two different writers, who lived two centuries and a half apart.
Speaking of the later <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id=
"page233"></a>{233}</span> of the two, he says (<i>Dictionnaire
Historique</i>, Paris, 1759, tom. i. par. ii. p. 87.):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Anglicus</i> (Michel), natif de Beaumont dans le Hainaut,
qui vivoit dans le XVI. si&egrave;cle, &eacute;toit po&euml;te et
professeur en droit. Nous avons divers ouvrages de sa fa&ccedil;on,

studiorum</i>, &amp;c. (Valer. Andreas, <i>Bibl. Belg.</i>)
Quelques auteurs l'ont confondu avec Michel Blaumpain. (Voyez
Blaumpain.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the earlier Anglicus, Moreri says (ubi sup., tom. ii. par. i.
p. 506.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Blaumpain (Michel) surnomm&eacute; <i>Magister</i>, Anglois de
nation, et <i>Po&euml;te</i>, qui vivoit vers l'an 1250. Il est

<p>Perhaps some of your readers may have access to a copy of the
<i>Paris impression</i> of Michael Anglicus, mentioned by Andreas,
Sweertius, and Hendreich. J.B. will not need to be reminded of
these words of Innocent III., in his first serm. de consecr. Pont.
Max., in which he claimed, as St. Peter's successor, to be</p>

<h3>CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.</h3>
<p>I must protest against the manner in which Arun (Vol. ii., p.
187.) has proceeded with the discussion of Caxton's printing at
Westminster. Though writing anonymously himself, he has not
hesitated to charge me by name with a desire to impeach the
accuracy of Mr. C. Knight's <i>Life of Caxton</i>, of which, and of
other works of the same series, he then volunteers as the champion,
as if they, or any one of them, were the object of a general
attack. This is especially unfair, as I made the slightest possible
allusion to Mr. Knight's work, and may confess I have as yet seen
no more of it than the passage quoted by ARUN himself. Any such
admixture of personal imputations is decidedly to be deprecated, as
being likely to militate against the sober investigation of truth
which has hitherto characterised the pages of "NOTES AND QUERIES."
ARUN also chooses to say that the only question which is material,
is, Who was Caxton's patron? <i>i.e.</i> who was the Abbot of
Westminster at the time,&mdash;who may not, after all, have
actively interfered in the matter. This question remains in some
doubt; but it was not the question with which DR. RIMBAULT
commenced the discussion. The object of that gentleman's inquiry
(Vol. ii., p. 99.) was, the particular spot where Caxton's press
was fixed. From a misapprehension of the passage in Stow, a current
opinion has obtained that the first English press was erected
within the abbey-church, and in the chapel of St. Anne; and Dr.
Dibdin conjectured that the chapel of St. Anne stood on the site of
Henry VII.'s chapel. The correction of this vulgar error is, I
submit, by no means immaterial; especially at a time when a great
effort is made to propagate it by the publication of a print,
representing "William Caxton examining the first proof sheet from
his printing-press in Westminster Abbey;" the engraving of which is
to be "of the size of the favourite print of Bolton Abbey:" where
the draftsman has deliberately represented the printers at work
within the consecrated walls of the church itself! When a less
careless reader than Dr. Dibdin consults the passage of Stow, he
finds that the chapel of St. Anne stood in the opposite direction
from the church to the site of Henry VII.'s chapel, <i>i.e.</i>
within the court of the Almonry; and that Caxton's press was also
set up in the Almonry, though not (so far as appears, or is
probable) within that chapel. The second question is, When did
Caxton first set up his press in this place? And the third, the
answer to which depends on the preceding, is, Who was the abbot who
gave him admission? Now it is true, as ARUN remarks, that the
introduction of Abbot Islip's name is traced up to Stow in the year
1603: and, as Mr. Knight has observed, "the careful historian of
London here committed one error," because John Islip did not become
Abbot of Westminster until 1500. The entire passage of Stow has
been quoted by DR. RIMBAULT in "NOTES AND QUERIES," Vol. ii., p.
99.; it states that in the Almonry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Islip, abbot of Westminster, erected the first press of
book-printing that ever was in England, about the year 1471."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it appears that the various authors of repute, who have
given the point their consideration, as the editor of Dugdale's
<i>Monasticon</i> (Sir Henry Ellis), and Mr. Cunningham in his
<i>Handbook</i>, affirm that it is John Esteney who became abbot in
1474 or 1475, and not Thomas Milling, who was abbot in 1471, whose
name should be substituted for that of Islip. In that case, Stowe
committed two errors instead of one; he was wrong in his date as
well as his name. It is to this point that I directed my remarks,
which are printed in Vol. ii., p. 142. We have hitherto no evidence
that Caxton <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
"page234"></a>{234}</span> printed at Westminster before the year
1477, six years later than mentioned by Stow.</p>

<h3>THE USE OF COFFINS.</h3>
<p>The Query of H.E. (Vol. i., p. 321.) seems to infer that the use
of coffins may be only a modern custom. In book xxiii., chapters i.
and ii., of Bingham's <i>Antiquities of the Christian Church</i>,
H.E. will find ample proof of the very early use of coffins. During
the first three centuries of the Church, one great distinction
betwixt Heathens and Christians was, that the former burned their
dead, and placed the bones and ashes in urns; whilst the latter
always buried the corpse, either in a coffin or, embalmed, in a
catacomb; so that it might be restored at the last day from its
original dust. There have frequently been dug out of the barrows
which contain Roman urns, ancient British stone coffins. Bede
mentions that the Saxons buried their dead in wood. Coffins both of
lead and iron were constructed at a very early period. When the
royal vaults at St. Denis were desecrated, during the first French
revolution, coffins were exposed that had lain there for ages.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, it appears to be the case that, both
in the Norman and English periods, the common people of this
country were often wrapped in a sere-cloth after death, and so
placed, coffinless, in the earth. The illuminations in the old
missals represent this. And it is not impossible that the extract
from the "Table of Dutyes," on which H.E. founds his inquiry, may
refer to a lingering continuance of this rude custom. Indeed, a
statute passed in 1678, ordering that all dead bodies shall be
interred in woollen and no other material, is so worded as to give
the idea that there might be interments without coffins. The
statute forbids that any person be put in, wrapt, or wound up, or
buried in any shirt, shift, sheet, or shroud, unless made of
sheep's wool only; or in any coffin lined or faced with any
material but sheep's wool; as if the person might be buried either
in a garment, or in a coffin, so long as the former was made of, or
the latter lined with, wool.</p>
<p>I think the "buryall without a coffin," quoted by H.E., must
have referred to the interment of the poorest class. Their friends,
being unable to provide a coffin, conformed to an old rude custom,
which had not entirely ceased.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF THE WORD "DELIGHTED".</h3>
<p>If the passage from <i>Measure for Measure</i>, which has been
the subject of much controversy in your recent numbers, be read in
its natural sense&mdash;there is surely nothing unintelligible in
the word "delighted" as there used.</p>
<p>The object of the poet was to show how instinctively the mind
shudders at the change produced by death&mdash;both on body and
soul; and how repulsive it must be to an active and sentient
being.</p>
<p>He therefore places in frightful contrast the condition of
<i>each</i> before and after that awful change. The BODY,
<i>now</i> endowed with "sensible warm motion," to become in death
"a kneaded clod," to "lie in cold obstruction, and to rot." The
SPIRIT, <i>now</i> "delighted" (all full of delight), to become in
death utterly powerless, an unconscious&mdash;passive
thing&mdash;"imprisoned in the viewless winds, and blown with
restless violence round about the pendant world," how intolerable
the thought, and how repulsive the contrast! It is <i>not</i> in
its state <i>after death</i>, but <i>during life</i>, that the poet
represents the spirit to be a "delighted one." If we fall into the
error of supposing him to refer to the <i>former</i> period, we are
compelled to alter our text, in order to make the passage
intelligible, or invent some new meaning to the word "delighted,"
and, at the same time, we deprive the passage of the strong
antithesis in which all its spirit and force consists. It is this
strong antithesis, this painfully marked contrast between the two
states of <i>each, body</i> and <i>spirit</i>, which displays the
power and skill of the poet in handling the subject. Without it,
the passage loses half its meaning.</p>
<p>MR. HICKSON will not, I hope, accuse one who is no critic for
presuming to offer this suggestion. I tender it with diffidence,
being conscious that, although a passionate admirer of the great
bard, I am all unlearned in the art of criticism, "a plain
unlettered man," and therefore simply take what is set before me in
its natural sense, as well as I may, without searching for
recondite interpretations. On this account, I feel doubly the
necessity of apologising for interfering with the labours of so
learned and able a commentator as MR. HICKSON has shown himself to
be.</p>

<h3>VENTRILOQUISM</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 88.)</h4>
<p>Plutarch (tom. ii., p. 397.D.) has these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Ou gar esti theou hae gaerus oude ho phthoggos, oude he
lexis, oude to metron, alla taes yunaikos: ekeinos de monas tas
phantasias paristaesi, kau phos en tae psuchae poiei pros to
mellon."]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that be the passage referred to be Rollin, nothing is said
there about ventriloquism. The Scholiast on Aristoph. (<i>Plut.</i>
39.) tells us how the Pythian received the <i>afflatus</i>, but
says nothing about her <i>speaking</i> from her belly: He only
has</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Ta taes manteias hae mallon manias ephtheggeto
hraemata."]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place of Plutarch (tom. ii., p. 414. E.) we have
[Greek: eggastrimuthoi] and [Greek: puthones] used as synonymous
words to express persons into whose bodies the god might be
supposed to enter, "using their <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page235" id="page235"></a>{235}</span> bodies and voices as
instruments." The only word in that passage which appears to hint
at what we call ventriloquism is [Greek: hupophtheggesthai].</p>
<p>I have very little doubt that amongst the various tricks of
ancient divination ventriloquism found a place; but I cannot give
that direct evidence which MR. SANSOM asks for. I think it very
likely that "<i>the wizards that peep and mutter</i>" (Isa. viii.
19.) were of this class; but it is not clear that the [Hebrew:
'obot]&mdash;the [Greek eggastrimuthoi] of the LXX.&mdash;were so.
The English version has "them that have familiar spirits." The
Hebrew word signifies <i>bottles</i>; and this may mean no more
than that the spirit of divination was contained in the person's
body as in a bottle, "using his body and his voice as instruments,"
as in the place of Plutarch quoted above. We have something like
this, Acts, xix. 15., where "the evil spirit answered," no doubt in
the voice of the demoniac, "Jesus I know," &amp;c. Michaelis
(Suppl., p. 39.) gives a different meaning and etymology to
[Hebrew: 'obot]. He derives it from the Arabic, which signifies (1)
<i>rediit</i>, (2) <i>occidit</i> sol, (3) <i>noctu venit</i> or
<i>noctu aliquid fecit</i>. The first and third of these meanings
will make it applicable to the [Greek: nekromanteia] (of which the
witch of Endor was a practitioner), which was carried on at night.
See Hor. <i>Sat.</i> I. ix.</p>
<p>I do not think that the damsel mentioned Acts, xvi. 16. was a
ventriloquist. The use of the word [Greek: ekraze] in the next
verse, would lead us to infer that she spoke in a loud voice
<i>with her mouth open</i>; whereas the [Greek: eggastrimuthoi] are
defined by Galen (<i>Glossar. Hippocr.</i>) as [Greek: oi
kekleismenou tou stomatos phthengomenoi].</p>
<p>Consult Vitringa and Rosenm&uuml;ller on Isa. viii. 19., Wolf
and Kuinoel on Acts, xvi. 16., Biscoe on the Acts, ch. viii.
&sect;2; where references will be found to many works which will
satisfy Mr. SANSOM better than this meagre note.</p>
<p class="author">[Hebrew: B]</p>
<p><i>Ventriloquism</i> (Vol. ii., p. 88.).&mdash;In reply to Query
1, I wish to call Mr. SANSOM'S attention to <i>Plutarch de
Oraculorum defectu</i> (Lipsi&aelig;, 1777, vol. vii. p. 632.), and
to Webster's <i>Displaying of supposed Witchcraft</i> (chaps. vi.
and viii.). Queries 2 and 3. Besides the extraordinary work of
Webster, he may consult the elaborate dissertations of Allatius on

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Earl of Oxford's Patent</i> (Vol. ii., p. 194.).&mdash;M.'s
quotation from the <i>Weekly Oracle</i> relates to Harley's having
been stabbed at the council-table by the Sieur de Guiscard, a
French Papist, brought up for examination 8th March, 1711. The
escape of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the subject of an
address from both Houses to the Queen; and upon his being
sufficiently recovered to resume his seat, the Speaker delivered to
him the unanimous congratulations of the House of Commons. Harley
was shortly after created Earl of Oxford, by patent bearing date
24th May, 1711, which recites, <i>inter alia</i>,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since, therefore, the two Houses of Parliament have declared
that the fidelity and affection he has expressed in our service
have exposed him to the hatred of wicked men, <i>and the desperate
rage of a villanous parricide</i>, since they have congratulated
his escape from such imminent dangers, and put us in mind that he
might not be preserved in vain, we willingly comply with their
desires, and grant him who comes so honourably recommended by the
votes of our Parliament, a place among our peer," &amp;c.

<p>In <i>The Ballad Book</i> (Edinb. 1827, 12mo.), there is another

only six verses and chorus. And the <i>Dublin Penny Journal</i>,

<p class="author">F.R.A.</p>
<p><i>Rotten Row and Stockwell Street.</i>&mdash;R.R., of Glasgow,
inquires the etymology of these names (Vol. i., p. 441.). The
etymology of the first word possesses some interest, perhaps, at
the present time, owing to the name of the site of the intended
Exhibition from all Nations in Hyde Park. I sent to the publishers
of <i>Glasgow Delineated</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> which was printed at the
University press in 1826, a contradiction of the usual origin of
the name adopted in that city, showing the impossibility of the
expression bearing any reference to the dissoluteness or immorality
of the former residents, and also contradicting its having any
thing to do with "rats," or "rattons," <i>Scottic&egrave;</i>;
although, in 1458, the "Vicus Rattonum" is the term actually used
in the Archbishop of Glasgow's chartulary. My observations, which
were published in a note, concluded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The name, however, may be also traced to a very remote and
classic origin, although we are not aware that it has hitherto been
condescended on. In ancient Rome was what was called the Ratumena
Porta, 'a nomine ejus appellata (says Gessner in his Latin
<i>Thesaurus</i>) qui ludiero certamine quadrigis victor juvenis
Veiis consternatis equis excussus Rom&aelig; periit, qui equi
feruntur non ante constitisse quam pervenirent in Capitolium.' The
same story is related by Pliny, from whom and other authors, it
appears that the word Ratumena was then as proverbially applied to
jockies as Jehu in our own days. From the circumstance of the
Rotten Row Port (of Glasgow) having stood at the west end of this
street, and the Stable Green Port near the east end, which also led
to the Archbishop's castle, it is probably not only that it was the
street through which processions would generally proceed, but that
the port alluded to, and after it the street in question, were
dignified by the more learned of our ancestors with the Roman name
of which, or of the Latin Rota, the present appears a very natural
corruption."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may here refer to Facciolati's <i>Dictionary, voce</i>
"Ratumena Porta," as well as Gessner's.</p>
<p>As to <i>Stockwell</i>, also a common name, it is obviously
indicative of the particular kind of well at the street, by which
the water was lifted not by a wheel, nor by a pump, nor a pulley,
but by a beam poised on or formed by a large <i>stock</i>, or
<i>block of wood</i>.</p>

<p><i>Passages from Shakspeare</i> (Vol. ii., p. 135.).&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p><i>Ang.</i> Nay, women are frail too.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Measure for Measure</i>, Act. ii. Sc. 4.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I should paraphrase Isabella's remarks thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If it be otherwise, if we are not all frail as thou sayest,
then let my brother die, unless he be but in the same case as
others; if he alone possess and follow thee in that particular
frailty to which thou has half confessed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A feodary, I should observe, was an officer of the Court of
Wards, who was joined with the escheator and did not act singly; I
conceive therefore that Shakspeare by this expression indicates an
associate; one in the same plight as others; negatively, one who
does not stand alone. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act iii. Sc. 2., we
read:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Senseless bauble,</p>
<p>Art thou a <i>feodary</i> for this act, and lookst</p>
<p>So virgin-like without?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>where feodary clearly means confederate, associate. According to
some, the word signifies one who holds land by the same tenure as
the rest of mankind; whilst Mr. Knight, in a note on <i>Henry
IV</i>. Part i. Act i. endeavors to show that it includes both the
companion and the feudal vassal.</p>
<p>"To owe" is frequently used by Shakspeare in the sense of to
possess, to own, as in Act i. Sc. 5. where Lucio says:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But when they weep and kneel,</p>
<p>All their petitions are as freely theirs</p>
<p>As they themselves would <i>owe</i> them."</p>

<p>In making a microscopic examination of the spots, I ascertained
that there was no new structure present; but in manipulating I
found that these spots absorbed water more rapidly than the rest of
the paper.</p>
<p>On applying litmus, these spots were found to have a powerful
acid reaction.</p>
<p>On submitting the matter to a chemical friend, he ascertained
that the acid in question was the sulphuric, or oil of vitriol.
Experiments were then made with a dilute solution of this acid on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id=
"page237"></a>{237}</span> clean paper, and spots were produced
similar to those of mildew.</p>
<p>The acid does not naturally exist in paper, and its presence can
only be accounted for by supposing that the paper has been bleached
by the fumes of sulphur. This produces sulphurous acid, which, by
the influence of atmospheric air and moisture, is slowly converted
into sulphuric, and then produces the mildew. As this may be shown
to be an absolute <i>charring</i> of the fibres of which the paper
is composed, it is to be feared that it cannot be cured. After the
process has once commenced, it can only be checked by the utmost
attention to dryness, moisture being indispensable to its
extension, and vice vers&acirc;.</p>
<p>I do not know whether these facts are generally known, but they
would seem to be very important to paper-makers.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrims' Road to Canterbury</i> (Vol. ii., p.
199.).&mdash;Your correspondent PHILO-CHAUCER, I presume, desires
to know the old route to Canterbury. I should imagine that at the
time of Chaucer a great part of the country was uncultivated and
uninclosed, and a horse-track in parts of the route was probably
the nearest approximation to a road. At the present day, crossing
the London road at Wrotham, and skirting the base of the chalk
hills, there is a narrow lane which I have heard <i>called</i> "the
Pilgrims' road," and this, I suppose, is in fact the old Canterbury
road; though how near to London or Canterbury it has a distinct
existence, and to what extent it may have been absorbed in other
roads, I am not able to say. The title of "Pilgrims' road" I take
to be a piece of modern antiquarianism. In the immediate vicinity
of this portion there are some druidical remains: some at
Addington, and a portion of a small circle tolerably distinct in a
field and lane between, I think, Trottescliffe and Ryarsh. In the
absence of better information, you may perhaps make use of
this.</p>

<p><i>Etymology of Totnes.</i>&mdash;The Query of J.M.B. (Vol. i.,
p 470.) not having been as yet answered, I venture to offer a few
notes on the subject; and, mindful of your exhortation to brevity,
compress my remarks into the smallest possible compass, though the
details of research which might be indulged in, would call for a
dissertation rather them a Note.</p>
<p>That Totnes is a place of extreme antiquity as a British town
cannot be doubted; first, from the site and character of its
venerable hill fortress; secondly, from the fact that the chief of
the four great British and Roman roads, the Fosse-way, commenced
there&mdash;"The ferthe of thisse is most of alle that tilleth from
Toteneis ... From the south-west to north-east into Englonde's
end;" and, thirdly, from the mention of it, and the antiquity
assigned to it by our earliest annals and chronicles. Without
entering into the question of the full authenticity of Brute and
the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, or the implicit adoption of the
legendry tales of Havillan and Geoffry of Monmouth, the concurring
testimony of those records, with the voice of tradition, the stone
of the landing, and the fact that the town is seated at the head of
an estuary the most accessible, the most sheltered, and the best
suited of any on the south-western coast for the invasion of such a
class of vessels as were those of the early navigators, abundantly
warrant the admission that it was the landing-place of some mighty
leader at a very early period of our history.</p>
<p>And now to the point of the etymology of <i>Totenais</i>, as it
stands in Domesday Book. We may, I think, safely dismiss the
derivation suggested by Westcote, on the authority of Leland, and
every thing like it derived from the French, as well as the unknown
tongue which he adopts in "Dodonesse." That we are warranted in
seeking to the Anglo-Saxon for etymology in this instance is shown
by the fact, that the names of places in Devon are very generally
derived from that language; <i>e.g.</i> taking a few only in the
neighbourhood of Totnes&mdash;Berry, Buckyatt, Dartington, Halwell,
Harberton, Hamstead, Hempstin, Stancombe.</p>
<p>First, of the termination <i>ais</i> or <i>eis</i>. The names of
many places of inferior consequence in Devon end in <i>hays</i>,
from the Ang.-Saxon <i>heag</i>, a hedge or inclosure; but this
rarely, if ever, designates a town or a place beyond a farmstead,
and seems to have been of later application as to a new location or
subinfeudation; for it is never found in Domesday Book. In that
ancient record the word <i>aisse</i> is often found alone, and
often as a prefix and as a terminal; <i>e.g.</i>, Aisbertone,
Niresse, Aisseford, Aisselie, &amp;c. This is the Ang.-Saxon
<i>Aesc</i>, an ash; and it is uniformly so rendered in English:
but it also means a ship or boat, as built of ash. <i>Toten</i>,
the major of the name, is, I have no doubt, the genitive of
<i>Tohta</i>, "dux, herzog," a leader or commander. Thus we have
<i>Tohtanoesc</i>, the vessel of the leader, or the commander's
ship,&mdash;commemorating the fact that the boat of some great
invader was brought to land at this place.</p>

<p><i>&AElig;dricus qui Signa fundebat</i> (Vol. ii., p. 199), must
surely have been a bell-founder: signum is a very common word, in
medi&aelig;val writings, for a "bell."</p>
<p class="author">D. ROCK</p>
<p><i>Fiz-gig</i> (Vol. ii, p. 120).&mdash;I had expected that your
Querist C.B. would have received an <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page238" id="page238"></a>{238}</span> immediate reply to his
Query as to the meaning of <i>fiz-gig</i>, because the word is in
Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>, where he may also see the line from
Sandys' <i>Job</i>, in which it caught his attention.</p>
<p>You may as well, therefore, tell him two things,&mdash;that
<i>fiz-gig</i> means a fish-cart and that Querists should abstain
from soliciting your aid in all cases where a common dictionary
would give them the information they want.</p>
<p class="author">H.W.</p>
<p><i>Guineas</i> (Vol. ii., p. 10.).&mdash;The coin named in the
document quoted by A.J.H. is the <i>Guiennois</i> a gold piece
struck at Guienne by Edward III., and also by his son the Black
Prince. It is not likely that the Guiennois was the original of the
name given to the new gold coin of Charles II., because it could
have had no claim to preference beyond the <i>Mouton</i>, the
<i>Chaise</i>, the <i>Pavillon</i>, or any other old Anglo-Gallic
coin. I think we may rest contented with the statement of Leake
(who wrote not much more than half a century after the event), and
who says that the <i>Guinea</i> was so called from the gold of
which it was made having been brought from Guinea by the African
Company, whose stamp of an elephant was ordered to be impressed
upon it.</p>
<p class="author">J.C. Witton.</p>
<p><i>Numismatics.</i>&mdash;My thanks are due to Mr. J.C. Witton
(Vol. ii., p. 42.) for his replies to my Numismatic Queries, though
I cannot coincide with his opinion on Nos. 1. and 3.</p>
<p>No ancient forger would have taken the pains to cut a die to
strike lead from; and my specimen, from its sharpness, has clearly
never been in circulation: why may it not have been a proof from
the original die?</p>
<p>Of No. 2. I have since been shown several specimens, which had
before, I suppose, escaped my notice.</p>
<p>On the coin of Macrinus, the letter below the S.C. now clearly
appears to be an &eta;, but the one above is not a &Delta;, but
rather an L or inverted T. It cannot stand for [Greek: Lykabas], as
on the Egyptian coinage, as Macrinus was slain by his soldiers the
year after his accession.</p>
<p>The Etruscilla, even under a powerful magnifier, betrays no
trace of ever having been plated and has all the marks by which
numismatists determine the genuineness of a coin. The absence of
S.C., I must remind Mr. W., is not uncommon on <i>third</i> brass,
though of course it always appears on the first and second.</p>
<p>I need go no farther than the one just mentioned of Tiberius,
which has no S.C., and I possess several others which are deficient
in this particular, a Severus Alexander, Elagabalus, &amp;c. After
Gallienus it never appears.</p>

<p><i>Querela Cantabrigiensis</i> (Vol. ii, p. 168.).&mdash;Dr.
Peter Barwick, in the life of his brother, Dr. Jno. Barwick (Eng.
Edit. Lond. 1724, 8vo.), after describing the treatment of the
University by Cromwell, adds (p. 32.) "But Mr. Barwick, no
inconsiderable part of this tragedy, together with others of the
University, groaning under the same yoke of tyranny, and each
taking a particular account of the sufferings of his own college,
gave a distinct narrative of all these barbarities, and under the
title of <i>Querela Cantabrigiensis</i>, or the <i>University of
Cambridge's Complaint</i>, got it printed by the care of Mr.
R&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;, bookseller of <i>London</i> who
did great service to his King and country, by printing, and
dispersing in the most difficult times, books written in defence of
the royal cause." See also <i>Biog. Brit.</i>, article

<p><i>Ben Johnson</i> (Vol. ii., p. 167.)&mdash;So the name was

is printed in the <i>Underwoods</i>, Gifford's edition, ix., 68;
but the MS. may contain variations worthy of notice. I should doubt
its being autograph, not merely because the poet spelt his name
without the <i>h</i>, but because the verses in question are only
part of his <i>Eupheme</i>.</p>
<p class="author">J.O. Halliwell.</p>
<p><i>Barclay's "Argenis".</i>&mdash;Since I sent you a Query on
this subject, I have heard of <i>one</i> translation, by Miss Clara

works. She commenced her literary career, I believe, by a
translation of this work, which she published in 1772, under the
title of <i>The Phoenix</i>.</p>
<p class="author">Jarltzberg.</p>
<p><i>Hockey</i> (Vol. i., p. 457.).&mdash;I have not observed that
this has been yet noticed: if such be the case, permit me to refer
to a letter of the poet Cowper, dated 5th Nov., 1785 (5th vol.
<i>Works</i>, edit. by Southey, p. 174.) in which, alluding to that
day, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The boys at Olney have likewise a very entertaining sport which
commences annually upon this day; they call it <i>hockey</i>, and
it consists in dashing each other with mud, and the windows also,
so that I am forced to rise now and then and to threaten them with
a horsewhip, to preserve our own."</p>

Works of Winthrop Mackworth Praed, now first collected by Rufus W.
Griswold; New York</i>, 1844. This collection contains some
thirty-six pieces. The longest poems, "Lillian" and "The
Troubadour," each in two cantos, display passages of great beauty
and exquisite musical flow. Among the charades, five in number,
"Sir Harry, he charged at Agincourt", is not to be found.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>We announced, after the last Annual Meetings of the Shakspeare
Society, that it had been determined to publish a complete set of
the Plays of one of Shakspeare's most prolific and interesting
contemporaries, Thomas Heywood; and that the first volume of such
collection, containing Six Plays, was then ready. A further
contribution towards this collection, containing <i>The Royal King
and Loyal Subject</i>, which has not been reprinted since the old
edition of 1637, and his very popular drama, <i>A Woman killed with
Kindness</i>, has just been issued, with an Introduction and Notes
by J. Payne Collier, Esq., the zealous and indefatigable Director
of the Society, and will, we are sure, be welcomed by every lover
of our early drama. The Shakspeare Society will, indeed, do good
service to the cause of our early literature if it prove the means
of securing us, a uniform series of the works of such of our
Elizabethan dramatists as do not stand sufficiently high in the
opinion of the uninitiated, to tempt the publishing world to put
forth their productions in a collected form.</p>

<p>THE ATHEN&AElig;UM</p>
<p>Of Saturday, August 31st, contains a perspective view of Mr.
Paxton's design for the building as finally approved by Her
Majesty's Commissioners, and now in course of erection in Hyde
Park. The Athen&aelig;um of Saturday, the 7th of September, will
contain a view of the south front, a view of the east front, a
portion on an enlarged scale, and a ground plan.</p>

<p>TESTIMONIAL TO DR. CONOLLY.&mdash;At a meeting held at 12. Old
Burlington Street, Saturday, August 3d. 1850, the Right Hon. Lord
Ashley in the chair; the following resolutions among others were
unanimously agreed to:</p>
<p>That Dr. JOHN CONOLLY, of Hanwell, is, in the opinion of this
meeting, eminently entitled to some public mark of esteem and
gratitude, for his long, zealous, disinterested, and most
successful labours in ameliorating the treatment of the insane.</p>
<p>That a committee be now formed, for the purpose of carrying into
effect the foregoing Resolution, by making the requisite
arrangements for the presentation to Dr. Conolly of <i>A Public
Testimonial</i>, commemorative of his invaluable services in the
cause of humanity, and expressive of the just appreciation of those
services by his numerous friends and admirers, and by the public
generally.</p>
<p>THE COMMITTEE subsequently resolved:</p>
<p>That in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate
Testimonial will be a PORTRAIT of Dr. CONOLLY (for which he is
requested to sit), to be presented to his family, and an ENGRAVING
of the same, to be presented to the subscribers; and that the
ultimate arrangement of this latter point be made at a future
meeting of the committee.</p>
<p>It has been determined that the individual subscriptions shall
be limited to Five Guineas; that subscribers of Two Guineas and
upwards shall receive a proof impression of the Engraving; and
subscribers of One Guinea, a print.</p>
<p>It is also proposed to present Dr. CONOLLY with a piece of
plate, should the funds permit after defraying the expenses of the
painting and engraving.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
